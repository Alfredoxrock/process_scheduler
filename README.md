# Process Scheduler

This is a college project that is a simulation of a process scheduler. It implements linked-list agorithms for the states of the processes once they leave the pool of tasks and move into the process scheduler. Then the program decides weather the processes are terminated or not. At the end, it shows the computer time it took for the processes in each state and each process has a priority from level one to level three.
